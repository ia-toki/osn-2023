<!-- Title: Lonely Ants -->

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
  Pak Dengklek found an ant nest underground.
  The nest consists of $N$ rooms numbered from $1$ to $N$ where each room contains an ant.
  There are $M$ tunnels numbered from $1$ to $M$ where the $i$-th tunnel connects rooms $U_i$ and $V_i$.
</p>
<p>
  Ants are social insects that like to work together.
  An ant is said to be <b>lonely</b> if and only if it cannot reach $2$ or more <b>other ants</b> (ants other than itself) from its room through one or more available tunnels.
</p>
<p>
  Pak Dengklek will choose a pair of integers $(l, r)$ that satisfies $1 \leq l \leq r \leq N$.
  Then, Pak Dengklek will destroy each room $x$ that satisfies $x &lt; l$ or $x &gt; r$ and remove each ant in those rooms.
  Of course, the tunnels connected to the destroyed rooms are also destroyed.
</p>
<p>
  Pak Dengklek is worried about his ants, so for a pair $(l, r)$, Pak Dengklek defines the <b>loneliness value</b> $f(l, r)$ as the number of remaining ants that are lonely after destroying the rooms.
</p>
<p>
  Pak Dengklek is bored and wants to find the sum of loneliness values $f(l, r)$ for every pair $(l, r)$ that satisfies $1 \leq l \leq r \leq N$.
  Help Pak Dengklek!

<h3>Explanation of Sample 1</h3>

<p>
  The following is the shape of the entire ant nest.

</p>
<p>
  As an example, for $(l, r) = (4, 10)$, the following is the shape of the remaining ant nest.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="render/semut01.png" style="width: 200px;">
</p>
<p>
  It can be seen that:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The ant in room $4$ can reach the ants in rooms $8$ and $9$.</li>
  <li>The ant in room $5$ can reach the ant in room $10$.</li>
  <li>The ant in room $6$ cannot reach any other ants.</li>
  <li>The ant in room $7$ cannot reach any other ants.</li>
  <li>The ant in room $8$ can reach the ants in rooms $4$ and $9$.</li>
  <li>The ant in room $9$ can reach the ants in rooms $4$ and $8$.</li>
  <li>The ant in room $10$ can reach the ant in room $5$.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The lonely ants are the ants in rooms $5$, $6$, $7$, and $10$.
  Therefore, $f(4, 10) = 4$.
</p>
<p>
  As another example, for $(l, r) = (8, 11)$, the following is the shape of the remaining ant nest.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="render/semut02.png" style="width: 200px;">
</p>
<p>
  It can be seen that each remaining ant can reach $3$ other ants, so there are no lonely ants.
  Therefore, $f(8, 11) = 0$.

<h3>Sample Input 2</h3>

<pre>
4 3
2 4
1 2
2 3
</pre>

<h3>Sample Output 2</h3>

<pre>
10
</pre>

<h3>Explanation of Sample 2</h3>

<p>
  All values of $f(l, r)$ are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>$f(1, 1) = 1$</li>
  <li>$f(1, 2) = 2$</li>
  <li>$f(1, 3) = 0$</li>
  <li>$f(1, 4) = 0$</li>
  <li>$f(2, 2) = 1$</li>
  <li>$f(2, 3) = 2$</li>
  <li>$f(2, 4) = 0$</li>
  <li>$f(3, 3) = 1$</li>
  <li>$f(3, 4) = 2$</li>
  <li>$f(4, 4) = 1$</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Therefore, the sum is $1+2+0+0+1+2+0+1+2+1 = 10$.
