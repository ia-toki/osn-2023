<!-- Title: Television Flickers -->

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
  In June, Pak Dengklek and his family go on holiday to the city of Bogor.
  One day during their holiday, they visit the Binary Square Mall and come across a television attraction that catches their attention.
</p>
<p>
  The attraction is displayed on a set of televisions that are arranged in the form of a square of size $N \times N$ with $N$ rows (numbered from $1$ to $N$) and $N$ columns (numbered from $1$ to $N$).
  The television located in the $r$-th row and the $c$-th column is denoted as television $(r, c)$.
  Each television can only be either turned on or turned off.
  Initially, each television is turned off.
</p>
<p>
  There are $P$ changes that will happen.
  The $i$-th change is in the form of two integers $T_i$ and $W_i$.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>If $T_i = 1$, then every television $(r, c)$ that satisfies $r \leq W_i$ and $c \leq W_i$ changes state.</li>
  <li>If $T_i = 2$, then every television $(r, c)$ that satisfies $r \geq W_i$ and $c \geq W_i$ changes state.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  When a television that is turned on changes state, then it becomes turned off.
  On the other hand, when a television that is turned off changes state, then it becomes turned on.
</p>
<p>
  After all $P$ changes happen, Pak Dengklek has $Q$ questions.
  The $j$-th question asks about whether television $(X_j, Y_j)$ is turned on or turned off.
  Help Pak Dengklek answer all of his questions!
