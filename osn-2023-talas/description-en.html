<!-- Title: Sharing Lapis Talas -->

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
  When visiting Taman Safari Bogor, Pak Dengklek finds $N$ immortal bunnies from an alien planet that are indexed from $1$ to $N$ from <b>oldest to youngest</b>.
  Uniquely, this bunny species reproduces without a partner, so each of these bunnies only has a single parent.
  To be specific, for each $2 \leq i \leq N$, bunny $i$ is the child of bunny $P_i$, where $1 \leq P_i \leq i - 1$.
</p>
<p>
  Pak Dengklek plans to give away Bogor's local food, the lapis talas cake, as gifts for the bunnies.
  Pak Dengklek has prepared $N$ boxes, numbered from $1$ to $N$.
  The $j$-th box contains exactly $j$ slices of lapis talas.
  Initially, Pak Dengklek distributes the $N$ boxes such that each bunny receives one box.
</p>
<p>
  Pak Dengklek knows that this bunny species is smart, enjoys sharing, and truly loves its descendants.
  A bunny is considered <b>sad</b> if and only if at least one of its children receives a box containing fewer slices of lapis talas.
</p>
<p>
  Each second, if there is at least one sad bunny, then among the sad bunnies, the <b>youngest</b> bunny (the bunny with the <b>biggest index</b>) will swap its box with the box of its child that contains the <b>fewest</b> slices of lapis talas.
  This swapping process is done repeatedly until there are no sad bunnies.
</p>
<p>
  Of course you are curious, is it possible for Pak Dengklek to distribute the $N$ boxes such that there will be <b>exactly $K$</b> swaps?
</p>
<p>
  Given an integer $Q$.
  If $Q = 0$, you only need to report whether it is possible to satisfy the problem condition.
  If $Q = 1$, you must also report one possible way of distributing the boxes.
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>

<p>
  The input is given with the following format:
</p>

<pre>
N K Q
P<sub>2</sub> P<sub>3</sub> &hellip; P<sub>N</sub>
</pre>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>
  If there is no way to distribute the boxes that satisfies, output a single line containing <code>TIDAK</code> (means no).
</p>
<p>
  If there is a way that satisfies, then output a line containing <code>YA</code> (means yes).
  If $Q = 1$, output another line containing a permutation of $[1, 2, \ldots, N]$ which represents a way to distribute the boxes that satisfies, where the $i$-th number in the permutation repesents the number of lapis talas slices in the box <b>initially</b> distributed to the $i$-th bunny.
  If there are more than one permutations that satisfy, you can output any of them.

<h3>Explanation of Sample 1</h3>

<p>
  The following is an illustration for the ancestry structure of the $N$ bunnies.
</p>
<p>
  If Pak Dengklek distributes the boxes such that the number of lapis talas slices in the box of each bunny is $[4, 5, 2, 1, 3]$, then the following events will happen:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Initially, the number of lapis talas slices in the box of each bunny is $[4, 5, 2, 1, 3]$.
    Bunnies $1$ and $2$ are sad.
    The youngest bunny among them is bunny $2$, so bunny $2$ swaps its box with bunny $4$.

    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Afterwards, the number of lapis talas slices in the box of each bunny is $[4, 1, 2, 5, 3]$.
    Bunny $1$ is sad.
    So bunny $1$ swaps its box with bunny $2$.
    <p>
      <img src="render/kelinci2-en.jpg" style="width: 400px; border-radius: 20px;">
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Afterwards, the number of lapis talas slices in the box of each bunny is $[1, 4, 2, 5, 3]$.
    Bunny $2$ is sad.
    So bunny $2$ swaps its box with bunny $5$.
    <p>
      <img src="render/kelinci3-en.jpg" style="width: 400px; border-radius: 20px;">
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Afterwards, the number of lapis talas slices in the box of each bunny is $[1, 3, 2, 5, 4]$.
    There are no sad bunnies.
    <p>
      <img src="render/kelinci4-en.jpg" style="width: 400px; border-radius: 20px;">
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  In total, there are exactly $3$ swaps.

<h3>Sample Input 2</h3>

<pre>
5 3 0
1 1 2 2
</pre>

<h3>Sample Output 2</h3>
<pre>
YA
</pre>

<h3>Explanation of Sample 2</h3>

<p>
  This sample is similar to the first sample, so there is a way to distribute the boxes that satisfies.
  However, since $Q = 0$ here, you do not have to output the permutation.
</p>

<h3>Sample Input 3</h3>

<pre>
8 265 1
1 2 1 3 4 2 1
</pre>

<h3>Sample Output 3</h3>

<pre>
TIDAK
</pre>

<h3>Explanation of Sample 3</h3>

<p>
  There is no way to distribute the boxes that satisfies.
