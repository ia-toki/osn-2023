<!-- Title: Bogor Defence -->

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
  Bogor is being attacked by an evil monster.
  Pak Dengklek is currently in a defence ship located on the Cisadane River.
  The Cisadane River is divided into $10^9$ sections numbered from $1$ to $10^9$.
</p>
<p>
  At the <b>beginning</b> of the $1$-st day, Pak Dengklek's ship is located on the $1$-st section of the river.
  At the <b>end</b> of each day, Pak Dengklek must do <b>one</b> of the two following things <b>exactly once</b>:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Follow the river current to move the ship from the $x$-th section to the ($x + 1$)-th section of the river, where $x$ denotes the section number where the ship is currently located.</li>
  <li>Use magical technology to make the ship be located immediately on the $1$-st section of the river.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The monster will attack the river for $N$ days from the $1$-st day to the $N$-th day.
  At the <b>beginning</b> of each day, the monster will attack all sections of the river except for one section.
  Formally, for each $1 \leq i \leq N$, the $A_i$-th section of the river is the safe zone of the $i$-th day.
  This means, Pak Dengklek's ship will <b>not</b> get attacked at the $i$-th day if and only if the ship is located on the $A_i$-th section of the river at the <b>beginning</b> of that day.
</p>
<p>
  What is the minimum number of attacks that hit Pak Dengklek's ship if Pak Dengklek moves his ship optimally?
</p>

<h3>Explanation of Sample</h3>

<p>
  One of the optimal strategies is as follows:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    At the beginning of the $1$-st day, the ship is on the $1$-st section.
    The safe zone is at the $2$-nd section, so the ship gets attacked.
    Then, the ship follows the current to move to the $2$-nd section.
  </li>
  <li>
    At the beginning of the $2$-nd day, the ship is on the $2$-nd section.
    The safe zone is at the $2$-nd section, so the ship does not get attacked.
    Then, the ship follows the current to move to the $3$-rd section.
  </li>
  <li>
    At the beginning of the $3$-rd day, the ship is on the $3$-rd section.
    The safe zone is at the $3$-rd section, so the ship does not get attacked.
    Then, the ship follows the current to move to the $4$-th section.
  </li>
  <li>
    At the beginning of the $4$-th day, the ship is on the $4$-th section.
    The safe zone is at the $2$-nd section, so the ship gets attacked.
    Then, the ship uses magical technology to be located immediately on the $1$-st section.
  </li>
  <li>
    At the beginning of the $5$-th day, the ship is on the $1$-st section.
    The safe zone is at the $1$-st section, so the ship does not get attacked.
    Then, the ship uses magical technology to be located immediately on the $1$-st section.
  </li>
  <li>
    At the beginning of the $6$-th day, the ship is on the $1$-st section.
    The safe zone is at the $4$-th section, so the ship gets attacked.
    Then, the ship follows the current to move to the $2$-nd section.
  </li>
  <li>
    At the beginning of the $7$-th day, the ship is on the $2$-nd section.
    The safe zone is at the $2$-nd section, so the ship does not get attacked.
    Then, the ship follows the current to move to the $3$-rd section.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  The following is an illustration for the strategy above.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>
<p>
  Following this strategy, Pak Dengklek's ship will get attacked $3$ times, at the $1$-st, $4$-th, and $6$-th day.
  It can be proven that there is no strategy where the ship gets attacked fewer than $3$ times.
