<!-- Title: One-Day Delivery -->

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
  Kwak, Kwik, and Kwek are going on holiday to Puncak, Bogor and they find a giant spotted deer who lost her shoes.
  Pak Dengklek can make her shoes, but Pak Dengklek is currently located in Jakarta and cannot catch up with his ducks.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>
<p>
  Each <b>morning</b>, Pak Dengklek makes exactly one shoe of a certain size and immediately delivers it to Puncak.
  Unfortunately, since Puncak is a tourist destination that is always crowded, the fastest delivery to Puncak requires a duration of one day, so the shoe that is delivered will only arrive in Puncak in the <b>night of the next day</b>.
</p>
<p>
  When a shoe arrives in Puncak, Pak Dengklek's ducks will immediately send an online message instantly to Pak Dengklek in order to explain the condition of the shoe that just arrived.
  The possible messages are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>KEKECILAN</code> &ndash; the shoe is too small for the deer.</li>
  <li><code>KEBESARAN</code> &ndash; the shoe is too big for the deer.</li>
  <li><code>PAS</code> &ndash; the shoe fits.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  It is known that the shoe size of the deer is a positive integer not exceeding $N$.
  Of course, in order to not be wasteful, each shoe Pak Dengklek makes must have a positive integer size not exceeding $N$ as well.
  The deer lets the ducks know that she needs a shoe with the right size by no later than the night of the $T$-th day.
  Help Pak Dengklek arrange a plan of making shoes for each day so that the deer gets a shoe of the right size in the desired time restriction!
</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
  <li>$1 \leq N \leq 10^9$</li>
</ul>

<h3>Subtasks</h3>

<ol>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6 points) $N = 5$; $T = 6$</li>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;(6 points) $N = 7$; $T = 5$</li>
  <li>(21 points) $N = 50$; $T = 9$</li>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9 points) $N = 350$; $T = 13$</li>
  <li>(12 points) $N = 2500$; $T = 17$</li>
  <li>(20 points) $N = 300\,000$; $T = 27$</li>
  <li>(26 points) $N = 10^9$; $T = 100$</li>
</ol>  

<h3>Problem Type Information</h3>

<p>
  This is an &quot;interactive&quot; problem.
  In this problem, you will interact with the judge's program through standard input (<em>stdin</em>) and standard output (<em>stdout</em>).
  See the following interaction carefully.
</p>

<h3>Interaction</h3>

<p>
  Initially, you will be given the values $N$ and $T$ in the following format:
</p>
<pre>
N T
</pre>
<p>
  Then, at most $T$ times, you can give an output in the following format:
</p>
<pre>
K
</pre>
<p>
  with $1 \leq K \leq N$.
</p>
<p>
  This means, in the morning, Pak Dengklek makes exactly one shoe of size $K$ and immediately delivers it to Puncak.
  Right after each of your outputs (other than your first output), you are given the online message sent by the ducks (notated by $S$) in the night of the same day.
  Note that this message explains the condition of the shoe Pak Dengklek made in the <b>morning of the previous day</b>.
  String $S$ is given in the following format:
</p>
<pre>
S
</pre>
<p>
  If you get the message <code>PAS</code>, it means that the deer has already got a shoe that fits.
  Right after that happens, the interaction between your program and the judge's program must be stopped immediately.
</p>
<p>
  In some test cases, the behaviour of the grader is adaptive.
  This means that in these test cases, the grader does not have a fixed shoe size before the interaction starts.
  Instead, the answers given by the grader may depend on the questions asked by your solution.
  However, it is guaranteed that the grader answers in such a way that after each answer, there is at least one shoe size consistent with all the answers given so far.
</p>

<h3>Scoring</h3>

<p>
  Let $Q$ denote on which night the deer gets a shoe that fits.
  It can be obtained that the value of $Q$ is equal to the number of outputs you give right before getting the message <code>PAS</code>.
</p>
<p>
  If you do not succeed in making a shoe that fits, give outputs more than $T$ times, or give an output with the wrong format or outside the constraints, then you will get &quot;Wrong Answer&quot;.
  You will be considered correct if you successfully get the message <code>PAS</code> while satisfying $Q \leq T$, and you will get a full score or a partial score.
</p>
<p>
  Specific for Subtask 7, you can get a partial score.
  The formula used for determining the score depends on the value of $Q$.
  The value you get for Subtask 7 is calculated based on the following table:
</p>

<table border="1">
  <thead>
    <th>Condition</th>
    <th>Points</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody style="text-align: center;">
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left;">$100 < Q$</td>
      <td>$0$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;$44 < Q \leq 100$</td>
      <td>$\left\lfloor \large\frac{2\,250\,000}{Q^3} \right\rfloor$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: right;">$Q \leq 44$&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
      <td>$26$</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Sample Interaction</h3>

<p>
  In the following sample, $N = 5$, $T = 6$, and the shoe size that fits is $4$:
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Input</th>
    <th>Output</th>
    <th>Explanation</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><pre>5 6</pre></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>This means that $N = 5$ and $T = 6$.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td><pre>3</pre></td>
    <td>In the morning of the $1$-st day, Pak Dengklek makes a shoe of size $3$ and immediately delivers it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td><pre>2</pre></td>
    <td>In the morning of the $2$-nd day, Pak Dengklek makes a shoe of size $2$ and immediately delivers it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><pre>KEKECILAN</pre></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>The shoe that is sent in the morning of the $1$-st day (with size $3$) is too small.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td><pre>5</pre></td>
    <td>In the morning of the $3$-rd day, Pak Dengklek makes a shoe of size $5$ and immediately delivers it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><pre>KEKECILAN</pre></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>The shoe that is sent in the morning of the $2$-nd day (with size $2$) is too small.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td><pre>4</pre></td>
    <td>In the morning of the $4$-th day, Pak Dengklek makes a shoe of size $4$ and immediately delivers it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><pre>KEBESARAN</pre></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>The shoe that is sent in the morning of the $3$-rd day (with size $5$) is too big.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td><pre>1</pre></td>
    <td>In the morning of the $5$-th day, Pak Dengklek makes a shoe of size $1$ and immediately delivers it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><pre>PAS</pre></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>The shoe that is sent in the morning of the $4$-th day (with size $4$) fits.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>(end)</td>
    <td>(end)</td>
    <td>The interaction ends and you get "Accepted" for this test case.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  In the interaction above, we can see that the deer gets a shoe that fits in the night of the $5$-th day.
  Therefore, for this sample interaction, $Q = 5$, so $Q \leq T$ is satisfied.

<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>
  Always flush every time after your program gives an output.
